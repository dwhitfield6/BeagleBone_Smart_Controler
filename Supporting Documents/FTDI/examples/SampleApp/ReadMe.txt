Objective: 
==========
This package contains the FT80x and FT81x sample applications targeting Windows PC, Arduino platform, EVE Emulator and FT90x platform.  
The sample application is created for tutorial purposes for smooth learning of FT8xx. The users are encouraged to read the source codes first and change the functions that they would like to experiment.

For any of the custom configuration other than the modules mention above, comment all the module macros and enable/disable the respective macros for resolution, chip, spi channels, ILI9488 etc.

Installation Instruction:
=========================
The MSVC project file is compatible with Microsoft visual C++ 2012 Express.
Please open the respective sampleApp.sln under project for MSVC(MPSSE) platform and MSVC FT800 platform.

The Arduino sketch file is compatible with Arduino 1.0.5.


Reference Information:
======================
1. AN_245_VM800CB_SampleApp_PC_Introduction.pdf
2. AN_246_VM800CB_SampleApp_Arduino_Introduction.pdf

Extra Information:
==================
1. Sampel Applications for Windows PC and Arduino platform shares share the same code base. But Windows PC has 
more APIs definition since it has no storage limitation. 



Known issues and limitations:
=============================
1. Will work only on SPI mode.
2. The SPI host(Arduino, Windows PC) are assuming the data layout in memory as Little Endian format. 
3. Cannot compile and build MSVC project using the version under Microsoft visual C++ 2012 Express.
4. FT8xx Emulator touch works fine for FT801, FT81x platforms.

=====================================
1.0.   First formal release
1.0.2  Fix the issue in "Ft_Gpu_CoCmd_Button" 
1.0.3  Add the support of FT800 Emulator, remove Doc folder , new readme.txt
1.0.4  Change the output directory of executable for FT800 Emulator based project
1.0.5  Update emulator library with Audio enabled
1.0.6 - Jun/23/2014 - Added multitouch sets and FT801 emulation support. 
2.0    Migration to FT81x platforms (Hardware and Emulator)
3.0    Added FT90x platform project.
3.1    Added support for VM810C50 module for msvc platform.
